# SQLAlchemy-Challenge
Itâ€™s time for a vacation! I have planned a trip to Honolulu, Hawaii. To help plan my trip, I am going to conduct some climate analysis in the area. Once I complete my data exploration and analysis, I will design a Flask API based on the results of my analysis. 

I will be exploring an SQLite climate database using Python and SQLAlchemy. I will then conduct my analysis utilizing SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
